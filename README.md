*Hello!*
Every time I visit GitHub, I am greeted by a tab asking me to tell about myself. It started to strain me, and I decided to get rid of it by fill this little README

So, what am I doing here? I am a student at ecole 42 in Russia, I also work as a QA in a small database security company.
Here I plan to upload tasks from school and scripts that I need for autotests at work.
